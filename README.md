## Problem
Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion

The problem does not specify what units to convert between. So below I will list the units the program in this repostiory will cover. Do not feel as if you have to complete all of these conversions, only choose the ones you feel confortable with first, after completing some of the easier ones try a hard one!
- Time conversions: Centuries, Decades, Years, Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds
- Imperial Liquid conversions: Gallon, Quart, Pint, Cup, Ounce, Tablespoon, Teaspoon
- Imperial Mass conversions: Ton, Stone, Pound, Ounce
- Metric Liquid conversions: Cubic meter, Litre, Milliliter
- Metric Mass conversions: Tonne, Kilogram, Gram, Milligram, Microgram
- Temperature conversions: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
